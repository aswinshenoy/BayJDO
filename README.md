#### !!  NOT AN ORIGINAL IDEA. JUST A SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION
```
To whomsoever it may concern,

- Neither the idea for this project, nor the technology used, were conceived originally
by the me (there is no invention of anything).  
- In fact, the project is somewhat still a basic & simple implementation of the 
already-popular technology in-use.
- I am no expert in the field, but only a learner trying to experiment with it.
- I do not claim any credit for the idea, & have always maintained & acknowledged the 
inspirations for the project (you can find as well as use them, I have mention them below 
in the inspiration section).
- I am open to any constructive criticism, and welcome any corrections / contributions.

Cheers,
Ashwin Shenoy

### üî• Features
* ‚úÖ **Light** - Lightweight Progressive Web App that runs on your favorite browser!
* ‚úÖ **Fast** - Does not use your internet too!
* ‚úÖ **Secure** - P2P WebRTC-based End-to-End Encrypted File-Transfer
* ‚ùå **No Special Hotspot** - Works with any existing hotspot or network between devices.
* ‚ùå **No App Install** - Works on any device with a modern web browser.
* ‚ùå **No Non-Sense** - Open Source, No Ads, No User Info Asked/Stored

#### üéà How to Use?
0. Ensure both devices are in the same network
1. Open Bayjdo in both devices, and from any one of the device enter the code of the other. 
(You may also make use of in-built QR-Scanner & Scan the QR instead)
2. Select files to send üóÇ
3. Wait till transfer is complete, üéâ

#### üí¨ Frequently Asked Questions

##### What technology does it use?
The app is completely based on web-technologies and runs on any modern web browser.
For establishing the connection between two devices, a WebRTC signalling server 
(PeerJS) is used. This server is however not involved in the data transfer process.

##### How is privacy ensured? üôà
All files being transmitted get encrypted by WebRTC standards, no one except the two
devices would be able to read them. For further clarification, no files are ever sent 
to any server, and the file are always transferred directly (P2P) from one device to
another through an encrypted WebRTC/WS channel. 

##### Are all browsers supported?
Sadly no. üòû Only browsers with the support for WebRTC can support Bayjdo, however,
all modern & popular browsers do support WebRTC and hence Bayjdo üçª

### üíé Contributions
Being an open source project, any sort of contributions - pull requests, bug reporting,
feature request, documentation help are all welcomed.

#### üõ† How to Run Locally & Develop ?
1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
   If you installed Docker desktop for Windows or Mac you don't need to install docker-compose separately.
2. Clone this repository and rename the folder to **webapp**. Create file **docker-compose.yml** outside this folder.
   
   You directory structure should appear as follows:
   ```bash
    my-project
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ webapp
   ```
3. Edit file **docker-compose.yml** to add the following:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.6'
   services:
     bayjdo_server:
       container_name: bayjdo_server
       image: peerjs/peerjs-server
       ports:
         - 9000:9000
     bayjdo_webapp:
       container_name: bayjdo_webapp
       image: webapp
       ports:
         - 3000:3000
       environment:
         - PORT=3000
       volumes:
         - ./webapp:/app
         - /app/node_modules
         - /app/.next
       build:
         context: webapp
         dockerfile: Dockerfile-Dev
       command:
         "npm run dev"
   ```
4. Modify property ***host*** of object **prodConfig** in *hooks/usePeer.js* to "localhost". Also modify the property ***port*** to "9000".
   
   Your prodConfig should look like:
   ```js
    const prodConfig = {
      host: 'localhost', // or internal-ip
      secure: true,
      port: 9000,
      path: '/signaller',
      debug: 1
    };
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è *If you wish to test the local install on another device you will need to use your internal ip-address instead of localhost.*
  *If you are on a linux based system you can find your internal IP by issuing:*
   ```console
    hostname -I
   ```
5. Run the following command to launch the server:
   ```console
    sudo docker-compose up
   ```
6. Access the client at localhost:3000 (or internal-ip:3000 in other devices connected to the same network).

#### üåü How to Contribute?
1. Fork the repository, clone it locally and run it following the installation instruction above.
2. Find an issue or feature to work on, and put up an issue.
3. Work on the patch or feature, test it and send a pull request referencing the issue.

###  üõë Disclaimer
This project is only being developed, as a hobby project and does not intend to
replace any popular file transfer application. The implementation of this project is
currently very basic, and intends only to be a proof of concept for the technology used.
This app may have technical glitches, security & privacy vulnerabilities. 
If you plan to use it for transferring confidential files etc., please look 
elsewhere for now.
